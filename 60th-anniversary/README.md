# Builds based on the 60th Lego anniversary sets

In 2018 Lego released 5 Classic sets for their 60th anniversary:

* Mission to Mars
* Ocean's Bottom
* World Fun
* Fun Future
* Rainbow Fun

Since the combined sets are quite diverse and enable lots of basic designs,
I kept them separate to limit what I could do with just those Lego pieces.
