# Builds based on the 60th Lego anniversary sets

In 2018 Lego released 5 Classic sets for their 60th anniversary:

* Mission to Mars
* Ocean's Bottom
* World Fun
* Fun Future
* Rainbow Fun

Since the combined mass of bricks is really balanced and enables lots of designs, I did not mix it with my other bricks to limit what I could do with just this amount of bricks.
