## Features

* Command module with cockpit controls for a pilot and rear window to watch stage separation
* Command module has a robotic arm, a light cannon and various connection points to store equipment or further modules
* Orange rocket has a drone head, but a minifigure can also sit there. When placed upright on the ground, could also double as a throne
* The main compartment of the orange rocket can be docked to the command module and can be opened to put a crew member inside
* Using the studs on the sides, modules can be arranged to form a little space station

## Meta

I wanted to build a modular rocket with multiple stages and utilize the transparent dome as a tip.

* Time needed to digitalize the model using [BrickLink Studio](https://studio.bricklink.com/v2/build/studio.page): ~90 minutes
* Dimensions: ~140g, 161 parts, 82 distinct parts, drone rocket is 17cm long
