# Good Industries Universal Pod

The Good Industries Universal Pod ("GI Pod", "UniPod" or "UP") is a modular spacecraft supposed to cover all imperialistic needs like logistics, resource extraction, construction, structure maintenance and heavy assault.
The project was 30 megaticks late and totally out of other budgets. Still, as claimed by military, industrial and political leaders, the UniPod is unparalleled to maintain peace and prosperity across the galaxies.

## Meta

The model started based on the "Lego Star Wars TIE Advanced Prototype" capsule design, which I needed to gut and adapt early on to keep the ball shape and introduce plenty of connection sockets.

I always liked the idea of a smallish ball pod with lots of connectors.

* The part base are various Lego Star Wars sets
* Time needed to digitalize: ~110 minutes
* Dimensions: 12x21x7cm, 215g, 244 parts, 119 distinct parts
