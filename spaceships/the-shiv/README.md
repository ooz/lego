## Features

* Extendable pedestals
* So minimal cockpit space, that if rear pedestals are extended, cockpit is open
* Minifigure gear attachment point
* Bot docking port
* Side rack attachment studs (left side)
* Pin attachment point (right side), used for [Mosquito](../the-mosquito/) sidecar add-on

## Meta

* Original goal was to re-use a minimal version of the [Dagger](../the-dagger/) landing gear for a new ship
* The main ship then looked so similar to the Mosquito, I built a sidecar add-on to make it look like a Mosquito
* I really like how the orange accent color worked out. It happened by accident due to lack of grey parts, then I added more orange to make it look intentional
* First model I digitalized in a long time, took some time to get into Bricklink Studio again
