* Spacious cockpit

* Light laser gun

## Meta

I liked the cockpit of the [Saucer](../saucer/) so much, I wanted to reuse it for a smaller ship. The design is inspired by retro sci-fi "flying cars".

* Time needed to digitalize: ~20 minutes
* Dimensions: 13x6x6cm (with pedestals extended), 67g, 91 parts, 49 distinct parts
