title: The Needle
description: Scrap metal pod
---

The Needle is what you assemble and fly when you do not have the funding for a [UniPod](../universal-pod/). Less pilot comfort, less armor, less weapons and fewer docking slots. It still gets the job done.

[Instructions (includes part list)](the-needle-instructions.pdf)

## Features

* Small cockpit pod with minimal pilot space
* One cannon, a droid/light container docking port and one slot for minifigure gear
* The engine provides more minifigure gear storage options. Alternatively the cannon can also be mounted on the engine
* Cargo pod with turret and further connection points
* Compatible with the engines of the [Wedge](../the-wedge) and [UniPod](../universal-pod/)
* The cockpit pod can be attached to the ["Square Falcon"](../the-square-falcon/)

## Meta

The design shows some compromises made due to running out of suitable bricks due to having built the [Mosquito](../the-mosquito/), [Wedge](../the-wedge/), [UniPod](../universal-pod/) before. It was originally intended to be the cockpit for the ["Square Falcon"](../the-square-falcon/).

* The part base are various Lego Star Wars sets
* Time needed to digitalize: ~40 minutes
* Dimensions (fully assembled with cargo pod): 21x4x5cm, 97g, 91 parts, 52 distinct parts
