## Features

* Spacious cockpit to store minifigure gear. Water storage and food processing (to the left of the pilot seat)
* Small cargo space with lid in the front
* Four pedestals that can be retracted
* Four cannons (one of which is a pellet launcher)
* Rotatable turret cannon
* Various outside clips to store minifigure gear
* Droid docking port or light container connector
* Can stand upright on its rear engine
* Rear engine can be replaced with the engines of [The Needle (TODO)]() and the [GI Universal Pod (TODO)](). Also supports the cargo pod of [The Needle (TODO)]() (see photos below)

## Meta

The design is heavily inspired by Star Wars' A-Wing. I did not want to buy the overpriced Lego set and built my version from memory (sans the A-Wing engines, I never liked those). The rear and engine part of the design is a bit boring, at least it's exchangeable. :)

I started with the cockpit and wanted to have a plenty of pilot space plus retractable pedestals. This resulted in lots of iterations on the base hull, to make it sturdy.

While making the instructions, I misassembled the turret piece (it is turned around), which resulted in an opportunity to save one 2x4 plate below the turret. In the photos below you can still see my original design before I broke it down to make the instructions. Overall this makes the turret slightly less tall, which improves aesthetics of the ship, but makes the cockpit harder to open when the turret is not aligned properly. Saving the 2x4 plate in the original design (180Â° flipped turret piece) would result in the turret not being able to turn when the engine is attached.

* The part base are various Lego Star Wars sets
* Time needed to digitalize: ~110 minutes
* Dimensions: 16x11x7cm, ~170g, 219 parts, 92 distinct parts
