## Meta

I built the first version in summer 2017. It started as a scooter, boat or submarine, inspired by motorcycles with sidecars.
Since then, I iterated multiple times, improving stability, connection points, pilot space and aesthetics.
It is still ones of my favorites due to the interesting asymmetry, small form factor and plenty of movable parts.

* The part base are various Lego Star Wars sets
* Time needed to digitalize the model using [BrickLink Studio](https://studio.bricklink.com/v2/build/studio.page): ~80 minutes (first time doing this, now I am more comfortable finding parts ðŸ˜ƒ)
* Dimensions: 12x12x5cm with extended wing, ~58g, 74 parts, 58 distinct parts

## 2020 Edition

End of 2020 I iterated on the model again, minimizing the massive "nose" and making the front scaffold "strings" more prominent. The weapon assembly got another cannon.
