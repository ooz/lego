## Philosophy

* I prefer models that are playable, functional, sturdy and at a scale that can conveniently be moved.
* I only use legal connections.
* I prefer minifigure scale.
* I treat greeble as an afterthought and do not compromise on the above in favor of more visual appeal.

Design approach:

* Focus on moving, functional parts first (e.g. cockpit, hatches, engine)
* Flesh out raw form
* Improve sturdiness
* Iterate

## Tools

All models are digitalized using [BrickLink Studio](https://studio.bricklink.com/v2/build/studio.page).

If you cannot see the brick inventory under Linux, make sure to use latest `wine` (e.g. 3.0) and launch it by:

```
wine Studio_32.exe -force-d3d9
```

For texts in instructions you may want to install the Microsoft Core Fonts using `winetricks`.

**Make sure to save regularly, since the software sometimes crashes under wine when making instructions!**

Resize model photos:

```
mogrify -resize 1600 *.jpg

Resize thumbnails:

```
