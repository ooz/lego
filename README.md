## Tools

All models are digitalized using [BrickLink Studio](https://studio.bricklink.com/v2/build/studio.page).

If you cannot see the brick inventory under Linux, make sure to use latest `wine` (e.g. 3.0) and launch it by:

```
wine Studio_32.exe -force-d3d9
```

For texts in instructions you may want to install the Microsoft Core Fonts using `winetricks`.

**Make sure to save regularly, since the software sometimes crashes under wine when making instructions!**
